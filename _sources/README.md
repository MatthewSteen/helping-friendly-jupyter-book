This purpose of this repository is to *document documentation* by providing an example of using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) and the [Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/) for authoring technical documentation.

## Biases, Caveats, Disclaimers

1. I really like Markdown.
2. I really like Jupyter Notebooks.
3. I prefer static site generators, such as GitHub Pages, because I'm not a web developer.
4. This isn't the *only way* to do this. For example, [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is another really nice Markdown and Python-based tool.
