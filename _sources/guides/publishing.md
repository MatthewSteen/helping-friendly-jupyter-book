# Guide to Publishing

Jupyter Books can be published on the web using GitHub Pages (no ads) via GitHub Actions, Read the Docs (with ads), or other hosts. One nice feature of Read the Docs is that documentation can be versioned to a repository's branch (e.g. latest and v1.0.0) through the project's settings on https://readthedocs.org.
