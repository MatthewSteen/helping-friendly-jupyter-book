# The Helping Friendly Jupyter Book

>...and the Helping Friendly Book will plant the seed[^1]

```{margin}
```{note}
This file (`docs/intro.md`) can double as the repository's README file if renamed as such. However, some Jupyter Book features (such as this margin note) won't work on GitHub.

>If you put your README file in your repository's hidden .github, root, or **docs** directory, GitHub will recognize and automatically surface your README to repository visitors.
```

This purpose of this repository is to *document documentation* by providing an example of using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) and the [Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/) for authoring technical documentation.

## Biases, Caveats, Disclaimers

1. This idea for documentation wasn't mine, but I've embraced it.
2. This isn't the *only way* to do this. For example, [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is another really nice Markdown and Python-based tool.
3. Jupyter Book is a young tool (current version is 0.15.1).
4. I really like Markdown.
5. I really like Jupyter Notebooks.
6. I prefer static site generators, such as GitHub Pages, because I'm not a web developer.
